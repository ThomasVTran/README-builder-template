# README-builder-template

## Desciption
This template is a README.md builder that takes in answers from users to questions that are asked of them when they run the program. It also serves as a test launch for my first product from my learning of Node.JS . While building this builder I have learned that my quality of code isn't allows how few lines I have, but also how effectively those lines are being utilized in the long run. I will be using this in the future to create READMEs on newer and bigger projects.
